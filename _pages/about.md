Hiya, my name is Amanda Domingos, and I am a PhD Student in Political Science at the [Federal University of Pernambuco](https://www.ufpe.br/politica) (Recife, Brazil). Also, I am a director at [MÃ©todos em Pauta](http://www.metodosempauta.com), a [BITSS Catalyst](https://www.bitss.org/), and a member of the [Project TIER](https://www.projecttier.org/) hub in Brazil.

My research interests are public policy, subnational and distributive politics, and open & reproducible research in social sciences. In my PhD dissertation project, I deal with intergovernmental relations and public policy in Brazilian federalism. More specifically, I focus on the subnational unevenness of policy provision.

Please, feel free to reach me out! I really believe that science is a built-in community and that we should get to know one another and collaborate more.
