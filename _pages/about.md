I am a PhD Student in Political Science at the [Federal University of Pernambuco](https://www.ufpe.br/politica) (Recife, Brasil), from where I also got an BA (2016) and MA (2019) in Political Science. My research interests are public policy, subnational and distributive politics, and open & reproducible research in social sciences. In my PhD dissertation project, I deal with the politics of public policy. More specifically, I focus on the role of budgetary amendments on the subnational unevenness of public policy provision in the Brazilian municipalities.

I *co-found* and *direct* [MeP](http://www.metodosempauta.com/) – Métodos em Pauta – an initiative that seeks to democratize the discussion of social research methods in the social and political science fields. In 2021 we received the honourable mention in the Scientific Dissemination award from brazilian National Association of Graduate Studies and Research in Social Sciences (ANPOCS). 

As part of the academic service, I am a [catalyst](https://www.bitss.org/people/amanda-domingos/) for the Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences (BITSS), where I help to educate and advocate for transparency tools and practices. I am also a member of the Project TIER (Teaching Integrity in Empirical Research) [network and hub](https://www.projecttier.org/person/amanda-domingos/). 

In 2021, I’ve received the *BITSS Catalyst Grant for Advancing Transparent, Reproducible, and Ethical Research* to conduct the [Brazilian Open Science Training]( http://www.bitss.org/project-tag/catalyst-project/) training for young researchers and graduate students, aiming to provide an overview of principles, tools, and practices for building more transparent social research in the long term.

Currently, I am a [Recognised Student in the Latin American Centre](https://www.lac.ox.ac.uk/people/amanda-domingos) (Oxford University), during the Hilary and Trinity terms 2022, under the supervision of Prof. Andreza de Souza Santos. 

Please, feel free to reach me out! I really believe that science is a built-in community and that we should get to know one another and collaborate more.
