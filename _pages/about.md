Hiya! 
I am a PhD Student in Political Science at the [Federal University of Pernambuco](https://www.ufpe.br/politica) (Recife, Brazil). Also, I am a director at [MÃ©todos em Pauta](http://www.metodosempauta.com), a [BITSS Catalyst](https://www.bitss.org/), and a member of the [TIER Project](https://www.projecttier.org/) hub in Brazil.

My research interests are public policy, distributive politics, and open & reproducible research in social sciences. My PhD dissertation project focuses on the subnational unevenness of public policy provision. 

Feel free to reach me out!
