I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Central Methodology at the Europa-Universität Flensburg, Germany. I received a PhD in Political Science (Political Institutions) from the [Political Science department at the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco](https://www.ufpe.br/politica) (2023). During the Hillary and Trinity terms of 2022, I was a PhD visiting researcher at the [Latin American Centre](https://www.lac.ox.ac.uk/people/amanda-domingos) (University of Oxford). In 2023, I also worked as a Data analysis and community outreach consultant for the International Panel on the Information Environment ([IPIE](https://ipie.info/)).

My research focuses on distributive politics and multilevel dynamics of public policy, and it seeks to improve our understanding of how and under which conditions distributive politics can generate positive collective effects. My thesis focused on how pork barrel politics spillover effects can improve healthcare indexes in neighbouring areas of the municipalities that received distributive resources. My primary region of interest is Latin America, with a focus on Brazilian municipalities. I am a [catalyst](https://www.bitss.org/people/amanda-domingos/) for the Berkley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences (BITSS) and a [member](https://www.projecttier.org/person/amanda-domingos/) of the Teaching Integrity in Empirical Research (TIER) Network, where I help to educate and advocate for transparency tools and practices. 

Before receiving my PhD, I earned a master's degree in political science (Democracy and Political Institutions) at the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (Recife, Brazil) and also a bachelor's degree in political science with a minor in International Relations from the same university.
