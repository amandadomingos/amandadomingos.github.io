I am a Postdoctoral Research and Policy Associate for the Lemann Foundation Programme at the Blavatnik School of Government. I hold a Ph.D. in Political Science from the Federal University of Pernambuco (Recife, Brazil).

My research focuses on the intersection of public policy, subnational and multilevel dynamics, and legislative studies, aiming to deepen our understanding of the conditions under which politics can drive collective outcomes in policy. In my PhD thesis, I analysed how the distributive politics' spillover effects can improve healthcare indexes in neighbouring areas of the municipalities that received distributive resources. Latin America is my primary region of interest, with a particular focus on Brazilian municipalities. 

I am also a [catalyst](https://www.bitss.org/people/amanda-domingos/) for the Berkley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences (BITSS) and a [member](https://www.projecttier.org/person/amanda-domingos/) of the Teaching Integrity in Empirical Research (TIER) Network, where I help to educate and advocate for transparency tools and practices. 

Before receiving my PhD, I earned a master's degree in Political Science (Democracy and Political Institutions) from the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (Recife, Brazil) and also a BA in Political Science with a minor in International Relations from the same university. During my PhD studies, I was a [recognised student at the Latin American Centre](https://www.lac.ox.ac.uk/people/amanda-domingos) at the University of Oxford.
